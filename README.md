The project is a part of [the Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).  
You can see the result [here](https://ivanpozdin.github.io/odin-todo/).  
## Project description
To-do list that supports following operations:
1) view all projects
2) view all todos in each project
3) expand a single todo to see/edit its details
4) delete a todo
5) add several projects to one to-do
6) add date to to-do
7) save data to local storage, so after closing and opening the website again the to-dos remains.
